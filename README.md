# Startup-Data-Cleansing
This repository contains Python code for filtering and transforming a dataset of startup entities. The process includes removing duplicates, handling missing values, filtering based on valuation, excluding certain entities, and extracting and aggregating relevant data. The final dataset is refined and ready for further analysis.
